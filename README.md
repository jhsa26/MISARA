# Starting MISARA
After you have downloaded the software, you should unzip the source code to a suitable directory. To start MISARA, you should run “MISARA.m” (path is: "./GSpecDisp1.4 /GSpecDisp.m") by pressing F5 in the Matlab editor. The software automatically sets the main paths and functions, but it requires the installation of the “GIPPtools” and “irisFetch” libraries. For any information, see the manual of the software.
